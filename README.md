# Project Overview 
This project investigates the relationship between aperiodic neural activity and sleep microarchitecture, with a focus on K-complexes (KCs) and sleep spindles (SS) during NREM sleep. Both electrophysiological events have been implicated in memory consolidation, sensory gating, and sleep maintenance. However, substantial variability exists in how these events are detected. 

The primary goal of this project is to examine whether variability in KC and SS detection is partially explained by underlying aperiodic dynamics. 

# Conceptual Motivation
Recent work has suggested that sharp-wave ripple-like events may primarily reflect broadband aperiodic fluctuations rather than true oscillatory bursts. This raises the possibility that other sleep microevents may be influenced by underlying spectral slope changes. 

To address this, we incorporate sensitivity analyses examining whether detection outcomes persist after controlling for aperiodic parameters and whether algorithmic detections are disproportionately driven by broadband spectral shifts.
